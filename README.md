## Description
Consider building software that invites citizen scientists and amateur ham radio operators to provide radio propagation data, both station-to-station and ISS-to-station. Your application could ingest this data, convert it into physical quantities, and/or display imagery of the Earthâ€™s ionosphere. 

This is the easiest static website to parse ham radio information.
